The app has two file: streamlit_app.py and environment.yml in snowflake.


There are two options for getting the images to display. You can either:

1. Put copies of the images in the same stage as the app, or
2. Use pre-signed URLs and give your app access to the stage where you originally stored your sweatsuit images.
Pre-signed URLs are a way for you to serve images to external users by giving them a link that has permissions for a limited period of time.
